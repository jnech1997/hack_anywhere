RIT Hackathon: GhostControl
*Built with William Estey

The idea behind Ghost Control was to create a way for someone to interact with their computer without using their hands. Using Swift's audio and visual recognition algorithms, we built a way for the mac user to make and move between desktop spaces only by voice and facial commands. The core motivation for building this was not only because we thought it would be cool, but also because we thought it would be useful for people who may not be able to interact with their computer with their hands. Our hack was successful by our measures, and the result is quickly demoed in the video linked below:
